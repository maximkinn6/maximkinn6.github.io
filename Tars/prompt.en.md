# Instructions

- Collect your commonly used prompts here for use with the Tars plugin commands.
- This file follows Obsidian's slide format, using `---` to separate each page.
- The first page contains instructions, and each subsequent page is a prompt template.
- Each template starts with a title in Markdown heading format, titles cannot be repeated. This is followed by the template content. Both title and content are required.
- If the content contains `{{s}}`, it will be replaced with your selected text.
- If there's no `{{s}}`, the selected text will be appended.
- If no text is selected, the template content will be used as is.
- If a page contains syntax errors, it won't appear in the command list.
- If you've edited this file, to load the updated templates into commands, please ==run the 'Load template file' command==, which will also check for syntax errors and display them in a popup.
